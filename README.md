Computer Organization and Design Projects

5-stage pipelining project developed across a series of 5 laboratories. Each lab implemented a different set of stages of the pipeline (starting with IF/ID and ID/EXE), eventually implementing the full pipeline. The completed product is capable of running various tasks according to the instructions present in the register file, values present in the data memory, and implemented instructions in the ALU. Additionally, as an honors task, a data hazard detection and handling unit was implemented. The entire code was developed by means of Xilinx Vivado 2020.2 software and tested physically on the Nexys A7 FPGA trainer board.
